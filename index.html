	  <h2>What?</h2>
Disaster Mapper is a tool to help you understand the hazards near your home, work, or other frequented area.  The tool utilizes open data from Federal, State, and Local Governments, as well as community organizations and community GIS repositories.  It will determine if the location you have entered is prone to a variety of natural, technological, or intentional hazards.  Preparedness information is provided for each hazard to help you and your family stay safe during an emergency.

	  <h2>Why?</h2>
Government and Non-Governmental Organizations can provide support to citizens during and after an emergency but, due to the overwhelming need for emergency resources, citizens could be without outside assistance for up to three days.  It is important for citizens to compile a disaster kit, develop an emergency plan, and stay informed with emergency alerts in order to reduce their dependence on emergency responders.  This tool will help you be better prepared for the hazards applicable to you in order to independently effect positive outcomes for you and your family.

Every citizen can utilize Disaster Mapper in order to better prepare themselves.  Share the tool with your family, friends, and co-workers to help spread the preparedness message.  Additionally, you can print the hazard page and display it in your home or work as a constant reminder to be ready for disaster.
