      Flooding is the nation's most common natural disaster. All floods are not alike. Some can develop slowly during an extended period of rain, or in a warming trend following a heavy snow. Others, such as flash floods, can occur quickly, even without any visible signs of rain. It's important to be prepared for flooding no matter where you live, but particularly if you are in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Even a very small stream or dry creek bed can overflow and create flooding.  For more information on how to prepare for them, visit the flood page at ReadyPhiladelphia.org.</p>

Though Nuclear Reactors have many safeguards, it is still very important to protect yourself against a potential emergency.  An emergency at a nuclear facility may include an explosion or leak Radioactive material can contaminate the air, water and ground surfaces for miles around. During a nuclear incident, it is important to avoid radioactive material, if possible.  As with any radiation, you want to try to limit exposure. It is important to avoid breathing radiological dust that may be released in the air.

Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms. They can appear suddenly without warning and can be invisible until dust and debris are picked up or a funnel cloud appears. Planning and practicing specifically how and where you take shelter is a matter of survival. Be prepared to act quickly.

      There are many facilities ranging from chemical plants to local auto repair shops that handle hazardous materials on a daily basis.  Some of these facilities may also be authorized to release products into the air or water.  In addition to the potential for a hazardous material accident causing a release into the environment, an explosion or fire may also be present.  It is important to know the materials that may be stored or transported around your location.
