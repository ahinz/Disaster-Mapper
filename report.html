Though Nuclear Reactors have many safeguards, it is still very important to protect yourself against a potential emergency.  An emergency at a nuclear facility may include an explosion or leak Radioactive material can contaminate the air, water and ground surfaces for miles around. During a nuclear incident, it is important to avoid radioactive material, if possible.  As with any radiation, you want to try to limit exposure. It is important to avoid breathing radiological dust that may be released in the air.

      There are many facilities ranging from chemical plants to local auto repair shops that handle hazardous materials on a daily basis.  Some of these facilities may also be authorized to release products into the air or water.  In addition to the potential for a hazardous material accident causing a release into the environment, an explosion or fire may also be present.  Itâ€™s important to know the materials that may be stored or transported around your location.
